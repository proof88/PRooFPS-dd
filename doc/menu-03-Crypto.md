\section terms Terminology

 - **Fiat Currency:** real-world money such as HUF, USD, EUR. [More on Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fiat_money)
 - **Blockchain:** a list of records securely linked together via cryptographic hashes. Examples: Ethereum, Tron, Solana. [More on Wikipedia.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blockchain)
 - **Cryptocurrency:** digital currency using cryptography for managing transactions. Usually we just say: crypto. They live on a blockchain.
 - **Stable Coin:** a cryptocurrency pegged to another asset, such as a fiat currency or gold, to maintain a stable price. Examples: USDT, USDC. Some also treat Bitcoin as stable coin.
 - **Altcoin:** alternative coin, basically any other coin which is neither stable coin nor Bitcoin.
 - **CEX:** Centralized exchange where you can trade using the wallet provided by the exchange. [Jump to section.](#cex)
 - **DEX:** Decentralized exchange where you can trade using your own soft-wallet. [Jump to section.](#dex)
 - **KYC:** Know Your Customer: a bundle of security measures to fight against money loundering, stealing, etc., basically you have to identify yourself in various ways to the service provider.
 - **FOMO:** Fear of Missing Out, you think you miss the chance of a good opportunity and feel worried (even though most probably you won't miss anything and should buy LATER).
 - **HODL:** Mispelled form of "hold" that became a meme in 2013. [Read the story here.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hodl.asp) Note that holding involves not selling the asset even in tough times.
 - **Dip:** A bigger drop in the price of a cryptocurrency, basically a good opportunity for buying!
 - **Eat the Dip:** Buy yourself in after the drop, so you get into a convenient selling position later.
 - **Ape (verb):** To ape: rapidly investing in a new or trending cryptocurrency, token, or DeFi project without conducting in-depth research or due diligence.
 - **Honeypot:** A coin is considered a honeypot if it cannot be sold after buy. Basically a trap prepared by the developer of the coin. Only developer can sell.
 - **Signal:** A trade signal is a trigger for action, either to buy or sell a security or other asset, generated by analysis. [More on Investopedia.](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/trade-signal.asp)
 - **FUD:** Fear, uncertainty, doubt. Tricky investor uses it as manipulative strategy to make other people sell their asset, so that its prices goes down and the investory can buy it low.
  
\section whybuy Why Buy?

To get RICH.  
If you are not an idiot, then it is not riskier than investing in stocks.  
REAL MEN are expanding their portfolio with crypto, not avoiding it.  
When there is a pandemic, a war or an economic breakdown, or any other bigger crysis, both the crypto- and stock market fall together anyway.

\section howmuch How Much to Buy?

The exact amount of money you wouldn't mind losing.  
A lot of noobs did put most of their salary into crypto because they heard it can go up to 10 times.  
And then by the end of the month they had to sell their crypto in loss because actually they needed that money to buy food and pay the bills.  
If you don't have game money then don't buy crypto.

**So only put in the money you would otherwise spend on drinks or other useless stuff.**  
Also, this is longer term investment, you should not expect big returns within a few weeks!

At the same time, you have to understand: you need money to make money. Small money will bring small money.  
You put in $100, not much chance of multiplying it by 10 easily. But, if you make 10x, you can consider yourself lucky, and it is still only $1000, you are still nowhere.  
Thus, you need to put in big money to make big money!

Later in this document I made a section about what to buy: I believe that for [Easy Level](#whatbuy_easy) and [Medium Level](#whatbuy_medium) you can invest more money with more safety than on other levels.

\section wherebuy Where to Buy?

\subsection revo Revolut

<table>
<tr><th>Pros<th>Cons
<tr><td>
Easiest, convenient.<br/>
Relatively safe coins (e.g. not honeypot).
<td>
High Tx fees.<br/>
Not all coins/tokens can be found here.
</table>

**Pros:**
 - Easiest, convenient.
 - Relatively safe coins (e.g. not honeypot).

**Cons:**
 - High Tx fees.
 - Not all coins/tokens can be found here.

Not good for frequent trading because of the extra fees you are paying to Revolut for each transaction.  
But this one is the most convenient for a beginner. Suitable if you wanna keep your money in crypto for long-term (years) profits.  
Also, the coins listed here are more safe to buy, i.e. not tricking you into a honeypot, etc. Still, price is volatile, so be careful!  
As per my latest info there is no way to convert your crypto to other crypto but maybe they already implemented it in 2024.

\subsection cex CEX (Centralized Exchange)

<table>
<tr><th>Pros<th>Cons
<tr><td>
Less Tx fees.<br/>
More coins/tokens can be found here.<br/>
Can trade between coins without converting to/from fiat money in between.<br/>
Relatively safe coins (e.g. not honeypot).<br/>
Tools like trading bots, copy trading.
<td>
Registering takes some time (KYC).<br/>
Sometimes you need to re-do part of KYC even when you want to send money into the CEX.<br/>
Can suddenly disappear, so dont keep your money there long-term.
</table>

**Pros:**
 - Less Tx fees.
 - More coins/tokens can be found here.
 - Can trade between coins without converting to/from fiat money in between.
 - Relatively safe coins (e.g. not honeypot).
 - Tools like trading bots, copy trading.

**Cons:**
 - Registering takes some time (KYC).
 - Sometimes you need to re-do part of KYC even when you want to send money into the CEX.
 - Can suddenly disappear, so dont keep your money there long-term.

**Centralized crypto exchanges** offer various trading options including borrow (loan), bots, and probably more suitable for frequent trading.  
However, you still gonna pay some extra fee to the CEX but probably less than to Revolut.  
Some coins/tokens are available only thru CEX. Definitely broader range than on Revolut.

The biggest inconvenience is registering yourself and going thru the whole KYC process and properly securing your account before using it.  
I feel like there is even more security measures in place than in online banking.  
Once it is setup, it is easy.

Examples of recognized CEX are:
 - [Binance](https://www.binance.com/)
 - [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/)
 - [KuCoin](https://www.kucoin.com/)
 - [Gate.io](https://www.gate.io/)
 - [Kraken](https://www.kraken.com/)

These exists for many years already and considered ok to use.

However, the general recommendation is NOT to keep your crypto there for long time but to withdraw it to your own crypto wallet.  
In CEX, you also have a wallet, owned by the CEX (it is NOT yours!), so if the CEX disappears, you won't have access to your wallet anymore.  
Such sudden disappears have already happened multiple times, examples:
 - [FTX crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bankruptcy_of_FTX)
 - [Mt. Gox crash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mt._Gox)
 - [Suspending BitForex](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2024/07/19/bitforex-to-open-for-withdrawals-following-chinese-police-investigation/)
 
So the recommended WoW for CEX is:
 -# you make account on CEX;
 -# you buy crypto on CEX;
 -# and then you withdraw that crypto into your own crypto wallet to keep there long-term.

Anytime later if you want, you can send back (deposit) the crypto from your own crypto wallet to your CEX account, just dont keep your stuff in CEX for long term.

Since you can withdraw/deposit/trade your cryptocurrencies without involving fiat money in these exchanges, you save money on fees you cannot save using Revolut.

\subsection dex DEX (Decentralized Exchange)

<table>
<tr><th>Pros<th>Cons
<tr><td>
Minor Tx fees.<br/>
Some coins/tokens can be found only here.<br/>
Can trade between coins without converting to/from fiat money in between.<br/>
If you have your soft wallet ready, you do not need to register on DEX.
<td>
Requires you to have your own soft-wallet.<br/>
Trading safety is not ensured, you might buy a honeypot.
</table>

**Pros:**
 - Minor Tx fees.
 - Some coins/tokens can be found only here.
 - Can trade between coins without converting to/from fiat money in between.
 - If you have your soft wallet ready, you do not need to register on DEX.

**Cons:**
 - Requires you to have your own soft-wallet.
 - Trading safety is not ensured, you might buy a honeypot.

Unlike CEX, **decentralized exchanges** don't give you a wallet. You have to have your own crypto wallet that you connect to the DEX for trading.  
But as I already recommended for CEX WoW, you should have your own crypto wallet anyway.  
You cannot buy all coins/tokens on CEX, some are available only thru DEX.

However, if you are buying a coin/token on DEX which is not listed on a CEX, you should do additional verifications before buying. See [honeypot scam in later section](#scams_honeypot).

Examples of recognized DEX are:
 - [UniSwap](https://app.uniswap.org/)
 - [PancakeSwap](https://pancakeswap.finance/swap)
 - [Jupiter](https://jup.ag/swap)
 - [Raydium](https://raydium.io/swap/)

\section whenbuy When Buy?

They always say to buy low and sell high.  
But what is low and what is high?  
It is difficult to tell if the current price is low or high because we don't know what is the reference price.  
The following rules might help.

\subsection whenbuy_01 When: Rule 1: Mind the Global Sentiment

Always check the all-time price chart of the selected coin and find reference points matching with global events, such as:
 - beginning of a pandemic;
 - beginning of a war;
 - economic breakdown;
 - in general, when media is talking about crash of the crypto market.

This way you can get a clue about what would be a correct reference price of the coin and compare its current price to it.

Also, some other decisions also have influence on Bitcoin price, like [Fed (Federal Reserve) interest rate changes](https://www.stlouisfed.org/in-plain-english/the-fed-implements-monetary-policy), [halving events](https://halvingdates.com/), etc.

\subsection whenbuy_02 When: Rule 2: Aim for Local Low

Also, try to find shorter-term cycles in the price and try to time your buy when the current price seems to be at local low height.  
Example: [short-term cycles in SAD HAMSTER price](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sad-hamster/).  
There were around 6 cycles between 2024 Jun and Sep where one could earn at least 6x~50% gains.  
Imagine you spent 100k HUF on HAMMY in Jun, then realize the total profit of ~1M HUF by the end of Sep!

\subsection whenbuy_03 When: Rule 3: Do NOT FOMO

I think most of my losses were because of FOMO-buys.  
I immediately lost a lot of money when I started crypto-trading at the beginning of 2022 because that was the WORST timing for entering the market.  
People made me believe at that time that I will miss the best chance so I entered. Few months later, I was in -80%.  
Why? Because I FOMO'd myself.

**Cryptocurrency prices are really volatile, what is expensive today will be cheap tomorrow and vice versa!**

Still, the lesson is hard to learn.  
So I made this separate section for this, to make sure I never do it again (I already did it many times even in 2024).

**FOMO will lead to losses instead of gains, so NEVER buy anything just because its price has already started going up.**  
This is one of the most difficult part because it is about controlling your emotion: the fear and worry of missing a good chance.  
Based on my experience you will just lose money and regret all the FOMO-buys.  
Patience with buying something always brings gains.

\section whatbuy What to Buy?

This question is both the easiest and most difficult to answer.

\subsection whatbuy_easy Easy Level

If you want to invest zero time in it and want nice gains, buy Bitcoin and hold (hodl) it for years.  
You can simply do this in Revolut too.  
You can see some possible historical gains in \ref btc_prices "the Example Bitcoin Trades table".  
This way, you cannot lose money!  
Keep Bitcoin even during tough times when you are in -50%!

<p align="left">
![](img/panicseller.jpg)
</p>

Bitcoin gives three chances to buy before it goes parabolic:
 - The first is near the market bottom.
 - The second is a few months before the halving.
 - The last is right after the halving.

<p align="left">
[![](img/btc3chances_thumb.png)](btc3chances.png)
</p>

\subsection whatbuy_medium Medium Level

If you want to invest more time in it and want even nicer gains in shorter term (weeks/months), then you need to have more diverse crypto portfolio, with cryptocurrencies of different sectors of the crypto world.  
You should discover what altcoins are in the market and buy yourself in.  
Usually the crypto projects have a white paper that explains the aim of the project and how they are planning to achieve the goals, who are in the team, etc.  
Then using your investor vein, you can decide which project to invest in.  

However, **the sad truth is: most of the time the big gains are not brought by the best projects but by the current hype.**  
The current hype is like seasons: you don't want to see Christmas movie in the middle of summer, but maybe during winter.  
So, my recommendation is to always look around on Twitter, Telegram and try to understand what the current hype is about.

For example, spring and summer of 2024 was about meme coins, especially on the Solana blockchain, big hype resulted in bringing in a lot of money, resulting in even more hype and more money.  
Maybe it is late to invest them in Sep 2024, but who knows ...

An important thing is: when BTC goes down, everything else also goes down. If BTC goes up, everything else also goes up.  
But the gains and the loses can be even more higher with altcoins, compared to BTC. This is the reason why we also invest in altcoins.  
Also, not all altcoins are moving at the same time: it happens that a meme coin goes up, another does the same with a few days delay, so this delay can be used to adjust your positions better.

**To minimize time invested, just buy and hold XRP and SDEX for medium-term (weeks/months).**  
Good entry price for XRP is below $0.51, for SDEX is below $0.011.  
Take profit when you want, then buy the dip.

Additionally, I recommend short-term (weeks) trading with the following altcoins in the table below.  
**As of 2024 Sep and Oct I believe in the following tokens to fly multiples times.**  
Reference price is an idea what I believe as good price to buy yourself in.  
I did not put recommended sell price, but in general selling in 10-20% profit is always the bare minimum, and personally I expect 20-30% profit at least per trade.

<table>
<caption id="altcoin_ref_prices">Altcoin Reference Prices</caption>
<tr><th>Name<th>Ref Price<th>Aug 23 Hype<th>Sep 13 Hype
<tr><td>NAME<td align="right">PRICE $<td align="right">PRICE $<td align="right">PRICE $
</table>

Aug 23 Hype: Bitcoin went from $60k to $64k for the first time after its $49k dip on Aug 5.  
Sep 13 Hype: Bitcoin went from $57k to $60k for the first time after its $52k dip on Sep 6.  

\subsection whatbuy_advanced Advanced / Difficult Level

Speculate to accumulate.  
The advanced level involves listening to **[signals and analyzing the charts](#signals)**.  
You can also try **daytrading** which is basically doing the same on daily basis. But this most probably leads to [what happened to Wojak when he tried it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcexKILIH10&ab_channel=WagieWojak).

Also, you can try **trading bots** which are auto-trading using your assets, based on custom parameters.  
Such trading bots are available on CEX for free, you can also see setups of other users as well.  
And there are external trading bots also which can use your soft wallet to trade, in this case no CEX registration is needed.

\subsection whatbuy_degen Degen Level / Casino

Degen is the short form of degenerate.  
These levels of the crypto world are for degens who risk some money for big returns within a very short period of time (minutes/hours).  
If you think that trading normal crypto is gambling, you are wrong: this level is the real gambling.

\subsubsection whatbuy_degen_general Random Hints

TODO: add about twitter, telegram, whatever.

See [honeypot scam in later section](#scams_honeypot).

\subsubsection whatbuy_degen_pumpfun Pump Fun

On [PumpFun](https://pump.fun/) anyone can create a coin on the Solana blockchain and other users can invest.  
The idea is, once the market cap reaches a specific value, the coin becomes publicly tradeable on the [Raydium DEX](https://raydium.io/swap/).  
Then, the journey of the coin can continue, its market cap can further grow as outsiders also start buying it.  
This can work only if the coin has a good narrative, the developer(s) and the community is active around it, social media is properly used for marketing, etc.
A lot of good meme coins were born on this site.

There are 2 ways of making money here:
 - either **you make a coin** and gather supporters investing in enough money so it can go to [Raydium](https://raydium.io/swap/) (then your investment is multiplied by 15);
 - or **you are investing in a coin** made by someone else.

**As of Sep 2024, 99.99% of the coins made here are NOT genuine, NOT made to establish a good community, and try to rip off any investor within a few moments.**  
The creators of most coins here don't even want their coin to make it to [Raydium](https://raydium.io/swap/) , just want a few people to invest and then rip them off ASAP.

Thus, if you want to make money by investing into someone's coin here, **the only good buying strategy is**:
 - list the coins whose dev is currently live streaming (that shows some effort from the creator);
 - if the market cap of the coin is shown below $15k, open its page;
 - check the wallet distribution bubble map (even tho not much use nowadays, see #scams_pumpfun_bundle);
 - if you are seeing active trades, invest a minimum amount of money (e.g. 0.1-0.3 SOL);
 - as soon as the value of the coin has increased 10-20%, SELL.

This way, you can ensure the following:
 - you spend minimum time in making money (e.g. 10 minutes);
 - you exit with profit.

People will hate me for writing this, as this is not how this site is supposed to work, but I have aligned based on my negative experiences and I don't want to be someone else's exit liquidity anymore, that's it.

**If you do not sell as soon as you are in 10-20% profit, someone else will do, and you either have to wait much more time to be able to sell in profit, or eventually you will have to exit with loss.**  
[Remember what happened to Wojak when he tried day trading!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZcexKILIH10&ab_channel=WagieWojak)  

If you want, you can repeat the above process with the same coin at its next dip, if you think there still will be people buying.

\subsubsection whatbuy_degen_sunpump Sun Pump

In Aug 2024 a similar website was born: [SunPump](https://sun.io/?lang=en-US#/pumpVote).  
The idea is the same, but this operates on the Tron blockchain, and its name comes from the creator of the blockchain (Justin Sun).  
A successful meme coin that was created here and reaching higher and higher prices in 2024 is [SunDog](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/sundog/) which is now also traded on the [Gate.io](https://www.gate.io/) CEX.

\subsubsection whatbuy_degen_crash Rocket Crash Games

The classic rocket crash game also has its Solana-based versions where you can risk your Solana for possible big gains:
 - [Solana Crash](https://solanacrash.io/)
 - [CrashOut](https://crashout.fun/en-us/solana)

Note that there are other versions for other cryptocurrencies as well, use Google.

\section whensell When Sell?

It depends on YOUR expectations of the coin.  
But here is my opinion.

\subsection whensell_btc Selling Bitcoin

We never sell Bitcoin. We hold it for life!  
But here are some example long-term gains with Bitcoin:

<table>
<caption id="btc_prices">Example Bitcoin Trades</caption>
<tr><th>Date of Buy<th>Entry<th>~ Duration of Hold<th>Date of Sell<th>Exit<th>~ Change
<tr><td align="right">Mar 1, 2017<td align="right">1k $<td>9 months<td align="right">Dec 18, 2017<td align="right">19k $<td>x19

</table>

<p align="left">
![](img/coinmarketcap-btc-chart-2017-2024.png)
</p>

As you can see, if your entry timing is bad, you need to hold longer to have some gains.  
The morale of the story is: with Bitcoin, you can ALWAYS make some gains, even with bad entry!

Note that you should always buy and hold Bitcoin. Even if your first entry was bad, then wait for a big drop and buy MORE to bring down your average entry price.

There are some exceptional cases only when we are selling it.  
**Sell Bitcoin only when BOTH of the following conditions meet:**
 - your exit price is higher than your entry price;
 - you are planning to buy yourself back later i.e. you are selling now high to reinvest for even more later!
 
This is because Bitcoin is going to the Moon!

For example, I sold Bitcoin around $60k on Aug 3, 2024 because I sensed the negative global market sentiment being continued and expected the price to go down more.  
So a few days later it could be bought back at $50k.  
Selling Bitcoin must be temporal only.

\subsection whensell_alts Selling Altcoins

Again: it depends on YOUR expectations of the coin.  
Unlike Bitcoin, not all altcoins should be kept forever.  
Especially meme coins because I think those are flying for limited time only. They are great for making money, but not so great for holding them forever.

\section appendix Appendix

\subsection signals Chart Analysis and Signals

\subsubsection signals_charts Chart Analysis

This topic is not crypto specific, this is coming from the stock market but applies to crypto as well.  
This is basically the art and/or science of analysing charts and trying to understand the market from the charts, and try to predict the near future of price movement.  
You should also watch the [linked videos](#videos) having "Trading" in their title.

Also I want to mention one of my favourite stuff is the [Ichimoku cloud for predicting price movement](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9e7OUfKTw6Y&ab_channel=TheSecretMindset).

Needless to say, chart analysis should be tied together with understanding [the global sentiment](#whenbuy_01).

\subsubsection signals_signals Signals

Your chart analysis can also generate a buy or sell signal but you can also receive signals.

Signals can come from various sources, for example, Telegram groups. NEVER pay for signals or to become member of VIP groups!  
You can receive chart analysis based signals in free Telegram channels/groups too.  
I'm not going to recommend any on this page.

Even if a signal tells you should buy, mind [the global sentiment](#whenbuy_01). You may postpone your buy, if the market situation implies a further downtrend.  

Note that such Telegram groups usually have quite a large number of members, so even posting the signal can cause change in the asset's price, since they have influence on buying and selling the asset.  
What I want to tell by this, is that just by posting a signal, influences the people to drive the price in the same direction as the signal predicts:  
if signal predicts increasing price, then crowds will be buying the same asset, which causes price increase, then we can say yes, the signal was right. :)

Always avoid pump groups where they say that a specific asset's price will be pumped at a specific time, I call it as [pump scam](#scams_pump_signal).

\subsubsection scams_honeypot Honeypot

Before buying a token on a DEX, we should check if the token is actually safe to trade.  
This safeness has nothing to do with the price, as the price is very volatile anyway.  
The smart contract may prevent us from selling the token after buying it. It can do it in multiple ways.  
To avoid this to happen with us, before buying the coin/token, we should use checkers.  
I use these:
 - https://apespace.io/honeypot
 - https://www.coinscan.com/honeypot-detector (note that I think it wrongly tells the "Contract Renounced" because it shows "No" even for well-known and safe coins)
 - https://check.quillai.network/
 - https://de.fi/scanner/
 - https://honeypot.is/
 - https://rugcheck.xyz/ (specifically for Solana-based coins. Make sure most of the LP is locked, Mint Authority is "-", and all of the top holders are in with low percentage (max 4-5%) per holder).

\section faq FAQ

\subsection wallet How to Get a Crypto Wallet?

There are soft- and hard wallets.  
It does not matter where/how you get your crypto, you should be able to transfer it to either a hard- or soft-wallet for long-term storage.  
Not all wallets support all blockchains, DYOR before buying!

**Hard wallets** are actual physical devices storing your wallet, they are considered the most secure.   
You buy it and set it up as per the vendor instructions.  
Examples:
 - [Ledger](https://www.ledger.com/)
 - [Trezor](https://trezor.io/)

**Soft wallets** are software where you can create and manage your cryptocurrency wallet.  
Usually they come in multiple forms, such as mobile app, browser extension, etc.  
Examples:
 - [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/)

I always check a price-tracking website such as [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/) which lists all CEX and DEX where a specific coin can be traded.  
For example, in case of Bitcoin, you can find this info [under the chart in the "Bitcoin Markets"](https://coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bitcoin/) section.

\subsection anon Am I Anonymous in Crypto Trading?

No, even if they try to make you believe, you are not.  
In 2024 we are already late to trade anonymously in the crypto market due to the regulations and security measures they introduced in recent years to fight against money laundering.  
The path of your money between the crypto- and the real world is pretty much trackable and in case of an investigation they will trace it from start to finish.  
So it is better to play nicely and do not scam people. Also, do not try to hide it from your local tax authority.
