v0.5.0

Do not forget to change recoil of the weapon to 1.0 so the bullets wont hit closer blocks too early!

From this version, we introduce the following changes:
 - instead of machinegun, machine pistol shall be used for firing.
 - BVH collision also needs to be tested, by manually overriding sv_map_collision_mode in cfg file.
 - measurement done on 2 spawnpoints:
   - first is the original spawn point:
     T bal fent belül téglás részhez, felugrani felszedni gépfegyvert, majd felugrani és vízszintesen kitartva lőni kelet felé amíg kiürül.
   - second is the rightmost underground spawn point:
     T jobb alsó underground részhez, ahol van közel machine pistol, felszedni, majd balra nézve vízszintesen kilőni a tárat.
