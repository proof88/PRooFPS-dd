v0.5.1 - new mch pistol firing rate

Do not forget to change some parameters of the weapon in its txt file before doing the tests:
 - acc_angle = 0.0
 - recoil_m = 1.0
 - recoil_cooldown = 0
 - recoil_control = off

From this version, we introduce the following changes:
 - instead of machinegun, machine pistol shall be used for firing.
 - in this file, all measurements with mch pistol have new firing rate, faster than mch gun's firing rate!
 - therefore, results are NOT comparable with v0.5.0 measurements!
 - BVH collision is the default from this version, no need to override sv_map_collision_mode in cfg file.
 - measurement done on 2 spawnpoints:
   - first is the original spawn point:
     T bal fent belül téglás részhez, felugrani felszedni gépfegyvert, majd felugrani és vízszintesen kitartva lőni kelet felé amíg kiürül.
   - second is the rightmost underground spawn point:
     T jobb alsó underground részhez, ahol van közel machine pistol, felszedni, majd balra nézve vízszintesen kilőni a tárat.
