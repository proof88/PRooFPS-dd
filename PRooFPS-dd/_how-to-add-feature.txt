 - Most important: update HISTORY.md.
   It will be much easier to release the next version if the history of changes is continuously updated.

 - Keep the packet rate and packet data rate calculations updated in PRooFPS-dd/doc/PRooFPS-dd-Packet-Rates.xlsx .

 - Add info to the About menu text if there is any new used 3rd-party content.

 - Update the wiki page on github (README.md), especially the "Try the game" and "Debugging" sections if needed,
   with special attention on the controls (keyboard + mouse).

 - Update the manual tests.

 - Run auto tests (unit- and E2E-tests) in full range to detect any regression much earlier than the release date.
   Fix if any fails.

 - If all the above is fine and overall the game looks fine, make a git tag with the development version number and
   "RC#" label where RC stands for "Release Candidate" and the hashtag should be a 1-based number that is increased
   with every new RC version within the current version.
   For example, if current development version is v0.7.0, then the first RC git tag shall be: "v0.7.0-RC1", then the
   next one shall be: "v0.7.0-RC2", etc.

 - If we fail to make a private or public release in time, we can still demo an RC version, but for this to work,
   the same quality assurance must be strictly applied as for private/public releases.
