 - Build a Release version with "Release" configuration;

 - Copy the built PRooFPS-dd.exe to the main PRooFPS-dd directory, overwrite the existing .exe there;

 - Start a server instance with "Team Deathmatch" Game Mode, and 1 client instance, then test the following:
   - Friendly fire working as per config?
   - Team Spawn Groups working as per config?
   - Check if Frag Table shows the 2 teams properly.

 - Now disconnect the client and server instances, and invert the Friendly fire and Team Spawn Groups config, then
   repeat the above test.

 - Start a server instance with "Deathmatch" Game Mode, and 2 client instances, then:
   - make sure the weapon switch for the server player and 1st client player is correctly visible in the 2nd client instance, and vice versa;
   - make sure that the player can go into the small tunnel on the very left side of warhouse by crouch+jumping;
   - with the default 1.5x jump-force multiplier setting, player should not take fall damage after a normal mid-air salto.

   - 3D sound check:
     - mute server and 1 client instance, check if you hear proper sound in the unmuted client instance;
     - mute the client instance, unmute the other client, check for same proper sounds;
     - mute both client instances, unmute server and check for same proper sounds.

 - Close 1 client instance, so only the server and 1 client instance are running;
 
 - Test the following weapon change-/switch-/pickup-related stuff in both client and server instances:

   - weapon becoming empty auto-behavior settings (needs to be tested separately on server and client instances!):
     - the idea is that we always make the pistol empty, and expect change to either mchgun or bazooka, because
       as of v0.2.7, bazooka's dpfr and dpsr are both bigger than mchgun's values, so it does not matter which value is
       actually being checked by the findNextBestWeapon functionality (I dont even remember but this way we dont need to remember).

     - tests for the "when current goes empty BUT HAS spare ammo" setting:
       - "auto-reload" current case:
         - trivial how to test.

       - "do nothing" case:
         - trivial how to test.

       - "auto-switch to best non-empty" case:
         - make pistol have non-0 mag + non-0 unmag;
         - have bazooka 0 mag + 0 unmag ammo;
         - have mchgun non-0 mag + 0 unmag ammo;
         - make pistol current;
         - make pistol empty, expect auto-switch to mchgun;
         - we stop test here, because emptying mchgun would test "when current goes empty AND has NO spare ammo" but we test it separately later.

       - "auto-switch to best empty but reloadable" case:
         - make pistol have non-0 mag + non-0 unmag;
         - have bazooka 0 mag + non-0 unmag ammo;
         - have mchgun 0 mag + non-0 unmag ammo;
         - make pistol current;
         - make pistol empty, expect auto-switch to bazooka;
         - if "Pickup-/Switch-Induced Auto-Reload" is set in settings, expect bazooka to be auto-reloaded;
           - we stop test here, because emptying bazooka would test "when current goes empty AND has NO spare ammo" but we test it separately later.

     - tests for the "when current goes empty AND has NO spare ammo" setting:
       - "do nothing" case:
         - trivial how to test.

       - "auto-switch to best non-empty" case:
         - same steps and expectation as with the same case under "when current goes empty BUT HAS spare ammo" config, except:
           - 1st step should be skipped: pistol shall have 0 unmag;
           - same steps and expectation;
         - pick up pistol ammo so it will have non-0 unmag;
         - make mchgun empty;
         - game will tell no better found, but in this case it should act like "auto-switch to best empty but reloadable" with best-effort,
           switching to pistol;
         - if "Pickup-/Switch-Induced Auto-Reload" is set, we expect auto-reload of pistol, otherwise reload it manually;
         - pick up pistol ammo so it will have non-0 unmag again;
         - make pistol empty;
         - game should not change to any weapon because there is no better left, but should auto-reload of pistol as last-resort,
           even if "Pickup-/Switch-Induced Auto-Reload" is not set.

       - "auto-switch to best empty but reloadable" case:
         - same steps and expectation as with the same case under "when current goes empty BUT HAS spare ammo" config, except:
           - 1st step should be skipped: pistol shall have 0 unmag;
           - same steps and expectation;
         - after the steps and we have bazooka current, additional steps as follows;
         - make bazooka empty;
         - expect auto-switch to mchgun;
         - if "Pickup-/Switch-Induced Auto-Reload" is set in settings, expect mchgun to be auto-reloaded;
         - make mchgun empty;
         - game should not change to any weapon (should log "no better weapon found to switch to" if that log is enabled).
 
   - The weapon becoming empty auto-behaviors have a rescheduling mechanism:
     if firing-induced auto-reload or auto-switch cannot be executed at the moment because the user is still pressing the fire button, the
     auto-behavior is postponed.
     Thus, this should be also tested manually!
   
   - If "Pickup-/Switch-Induced Auto-Reload" is set, an empty weapon should be auto-reloaded when:
     - switching to it either manually or by an auto-switch;
     - spare ammo becoming available by picking up.
     This setting is not affected by the "last-resort" auto-reload that is available when either of the "auto-switch to next best ..." settings is set, and
     also, this setting should not affect that "last-resort" auto-reload.
     If one does not want "last-resort" auto-reload, if no better weapon found, then the "Do Nothing option" should be selected for both of the
     "auto-switch to next best ..." settings.

   - The Pickup-Induced Auto-Reload also has rescheduling mechanism:
     if cannot be executed at the moment because the user is still pressing the fire button, the auto-reload is postponed.
     Thus, this should be also tested manually! 

   - Pickup-induced auto-switch tests:

     - Set "Pickup-Induced Auto-Switch to NEW Weapon" to: "Always Auto-Switch to New";
     - Set "Pickup-Induced Auto-Switch to ANY, if Current is Empty";
     - Start game, and:
       - Pick up Machine Gun, expect auto-switch to it;
       - Pick up Bazooka, expect auto-switch to it;
       - Empty Bazooka (both mag and unmag to zero);
       - Switch to Machine Gun, Empty Machine Gun (both mag and unmag to zero);
       - Switch to Pistol, Empty Pistol (both mag and unmag to zero);
       - Pick up Bazooka, expect auto-switch to it;
       - Empty Bazooka (both mag and unmag to zero);
       - Pick up Machine Gun, expect auto-switch to it;
       - Exit the game.

     - Set "Pickup-Induced Auto-Switch to NEW Weapon" to: "Auto-Switch to New if Better than Current";
     - Start game, and:
       - Pick up Bazooka, expect auto-switch to it;
       - Pick up Machine Gun, expect Bazooka staying the current;
       - Exit the game.

     - Set "Pickup-Induced Auto-Switch to NEW Weapon" to: "Auto-Switch to New if Current is Empty";
     - Start game, and:
       - Pick up Machine Gun, expect Pistol staying the current;
       - Pick up Bazooka, expect Pistol staying the current;
       - Change to Bazooka, Empty Bazooka;
       - Keep Bazooka the current weapon;
       - Pick up Machine Gun, expect auto-switch to it;
       - Empty Machine Gun (both mag and unmag to zero);
       - Switch to Pistol, Empty Pistol (both mag and unmag to zero);
       - Switch to the empty Machine Gun;
       - Pick up Pistol, expect auto-switch to it;
       - Exit the game.

     - Unset "Pickup-Induced Auto-Switch to ANY, if Current is Empty";
     - Start game, and:
       - Pick up Machine Gun, expect Pistol staying the current;
       - Pick up Bazooka, expect Pistol staying the current;
       - Change to Bazooka, Empty Bazooka;
       - Keep Bazooka the current weapon;
       - Pick up Machine Gun, expect Bazooka staying the current;
       - Switch to Machine Gun, Empty Machine Gun (both mag and unmag to zero);
       - Switch to Pistol, Empty Pistol (both mag and unmag to zero);
       - Switch to the empty Machine Gun;
       - Pick up Pistol, expect Machine Gun staying the current;
       - Exit the game.

     - Set "Pickup-Induced Auto-Switch to NEW Weapon" to: "Always Auto-Switch to New";
     - Keep Unset "Pickup-Induced Auto-Switch to ANY, if Current is Empty";
     - Start game, and:
       - Pick up Machine Gun, expect auto-switch to it;
       - Pick up Bazooka, expect auto-switch to it;
       - Empty Bazooka (both mag and unmag to zero);
       - Switch to Machine Gun, Empty Machine Gun;
       - Switch to Pistol, Empty Pistol;
       - Pick up Bazooka, expect Pistol staying the current;
       - Pick up Machine Gun, expect Pistol staying the current;
       - Exit the game.

   - The "Pickup-Induced Auto-Switch to ANY, if Current is Empty" behavior should NOT switch to the picked up weapon, if
     the current weapon is already being reloaded when the other weapon is picked up.
     If the picked up weapon is NEW, then this situation is controlled by the "Pickup-Induced Auto-Switch to NEW Weapon" setting:
     based on the config, it might or might not switch to the new weapon after reloading the current one.

   - The Pickup-Induced Auto-Switch behaviors also have rescheduling mechanism:
     if cannot be executed at the moment because the user is still pressing the fire button, or the current weapon is still not ready (e.g. shooting/cooldown/reloading),
     the auto-reload is postponed.
     Thus, this should be also tested manually! 

   - The firing-induced auto-behaviors have priority over the pickup-induced behaviors.
     This can happen if multiple auto-behaviors might kick in and being rescheduled.
     Since an auto-behavior is rescheduled only if there is no other pending auto-behavior already rescheduled, and condition for pickup-induced auto-behaviors are checked
     later than the firing-induced auto-behaviors, a scheduled firing-induced auto-behavior cancels scheduling a pickup-induced auto-behavior.
     Example situation: the current weapon becomes empty, and player is still pressing the fire button. The weapon can be reloaded automatically, or auto-switch to next best loaded
     or reloadable weapon can be executed, one of these will be rescheduled, even if in the meantime the player picked up a NEW weapon: switching to the new weapon
     will NOT be rescheduled, even configuration allows it.
