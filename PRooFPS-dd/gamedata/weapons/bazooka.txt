#  - burst: similar to semi, but 1 trigger pull shots some (limited amount) bullets after each other;
#  - proj : similar to burst, but 1 trigger pull shots some (limited amount) of projectiles AT ONCE, e.g. shotguns;
#  - auto : trigger needs to be pulled only once to fire continuously until we have bullet.

# For pistols, this is usually "semi".
# For shotguns, this is usually "proj".
# For rifles, this is usually "auto".
# Must be "semi" for melee type weapons.

# Also, user wont be able to select "proj" if that is not the default.
# The user is able to select "auto" though even if "proj" is the default, in that case
# weapon will shot projectiles in automatic mode (e.g. XM1014/Leone YG1265 Auto Shotgun in CS 1.6).
