#######################

# Textures for each map block/element
# Not defining texture for a specific block does not cause error,
# but the block will be automatically assigned a dummy red texture.
# Textures should be placed in a separate directory specific to this map,
# within gamedata/textures directory. The specific directory name should be
# the same as the map file name without the extension part.
# In this case the directory is: gamedata/textures/map_test_good/
#
# A quick note on supported image file formats: as of v0.4.2 only BMP file format is supported for textures.
# Please stick to NxN square size bitmaps where N is power of 2 (e.g. 64x64, 128x128, 256x256, etc.) and
# always try to use small sizes. Typically in this game using a 512x512 texture is overkill.
#
# For detailed info on supported formats and compatibility issues, please check the API doc/comment for
# PureImageManager::createFromFile(), somewhere around here:
# https://github.com/proof88/PGE/blob/master/PGE/PURE/source/Material/PureImageManager.cpp#L365
#
# Keep in mind that transparency/blending is NOT supported for map elements, therefore no use of 32-bit BMP
# files with alpha channel is recommended for block/decal textures.

# Foreground blocks are at the same depth as the players,
# meaning they can be used as either floor or wall, since
# the players will collide with them.
# The following chars are used for defining foreground blocks in this map:
# BDFGHIJ
# Remaining chars to be used as foreground blocks in this map: KLQT

#B = floor.bmp # intentionally commented to test if B blocks really get red texture assigned

# Notice when using texture-atlas.bmp I also specify texture UV-coordinates below.
# This syntax is explained in details in below comments.
# For now, the interesting thing is that I don't use exactly 0.0, 0.5, 1.0 values, but slightly
# smaller or larger. This is to avoid sampling from another sub-texture that would look ugly.

# Background blocks are 1 unit away from the players' depth towards
# the background, they can be used as background walls.
# The following chars are used for defining background blocks in this map:
# acnorempu
# Remaining chars to be used as background blocks in this map: uvwxyz

# Note that you can also change the texture coordinates for a block.
# Texture coordinates define how a texture is mapped onto a surface.
# In this case, the surface is a face of a block i.e. a side of a box.
# Each block consists of 6 faces.
# You define texture mapping for 1 face, and the same mapping will be used for all the 6 faces of the block.
# Normally texture UV coordinates fall in the range of [0, 1].
# Values bigger than 1 will cause the same texture to be repeated across the face, for example changing
# all U texture coordinates from 1 to 2 will cause the texture to appear horizontally repeated, and
# similar effect can be done vertically if you change value of V similarly.
#
# If you want to specify the texture coordinates for a face, then you have to define 4 values:
# - 2 floating point values for the UV texture coordinates of the bottom left vertex of each face of the block,
# - 2 floating point values for the UV texture coordinates of the top right vertex of each face of the block.
#
# Example:
# e = texture.bmp 0 0 1 1
#
# In above example, block 'e' will be assigned with texture.bmp, and the texture coordinates are:
# - for bottom left vertex: (U=0, V=0),
# - for top right vertex: (U=1, V=1).
#
# Illustration:
#
# UV(0,1)   UV(1,1)
#     --------
#     |      |
#     | face |
#     |      |
#     --------
# UV(0,0)   UV(1,0)
#
# From above definition, the other 2 vertices will be automatically assigned the following texture coordinates:
# - for bottom right vertex: (U=1, V=0), because it takes top right's U and bottom left's V coordinates,
# - for top left vertex: (U=0, V=1), because it takes bottom left's U and top right's V coordinates.
#
# If texture coordinates are not specified, it has the same effect as explicitly defining them as:
# 0 0 1 1
#
# In the below example, the same texture is used for 4 different blocks, but
# different texture coordinates are used by the 4 blocks, so that the texture spreads over
# the 4 blocks. This is useful if you want to display a single image using multiple blocks as
# you dont have to slice the image into separate image files.
#
# Note that with this technique, you can utilise a single texture atlas holding
# all textures for a single map, effectively increasing rendering speed on slower hardware.
# For example, if you have a 256x256 pixel size image, you can store 4 different 128x128 pixel size images in it,
# and use 0, 0.5 and 1 for U and V coordinates for different blocks to select the proper image.
# Sometimes you would have to use slightly altered values like I did above with texture-atlas.bmp, to avoid
# sampling from nearby sub-texture close to edges of polygons.

e = proba128x128x24.bmp 0.0 0.0 0.5 0.5
m = proba128x128x24.bmp 0.5 0.0 1.0 0.5
p = proba128x128x24.bmp 0.5 0.5 1.0 1.0
u = proba128x128x24.bmp 0.0 0.5 0.5 1.0

# The technique described above still has the disadvantage of using different unique characters for different blocks.
# It is okay if you are really using a single texture as texture atlas, but inefficient use of multiple characters if your
# purpose is just to display a bigger image like a decal/poster on a wall.
# For decal/poster purpose, I rather recommend using the "decal assignment".

#  DECAL ASSIGNMENTS  #
#                     #
#######################

# Decal assignment does not allocate any block chars.
# Decal is NOT a block, just a "plane" object having only 4 vertices, placed over the camera-facing faces of blocks.
# Role of decals is simply visual, and do not participate in game physics.
# Size and position of a decal is defined within the decal assignment, and you don't have to specify UV-coordinates.
# Unlike block assignments, decal assignments are anonymous as decals stay unnamed, and you cannot refer them in the map layout.
# They are not visible in the map layout definition. You define their position and size here within the assignment.
#
# Syntax of decal assignment:
#   decal = filename px py w h
# where arguments are:
#   filename  - texture filename, should be located in the same directory as block textures for this map.
#   px and py - horizontal (column) and vertical (row) position represented as block position, where the center of this decal should be placed at.
#               Floating point value.
#               Horizontal (column) position 0 represents the leftmost block, bigger values are going in the right (East) direction.
#               Vertical (row) position 0 represents the topmost block, bigger values are going in the downward direction.
#               Both px and py can be negative as well if for any reason someone wants to place the decal "outside" of the map.
#   w and h   - width and height of the decal represented as block size.
#               Floating point value.
#               Examples: 1 means exactly 1 block size, 2 means 2 blocks size, 1.5 means 1.5 block size.
#               Both parameters must be positive values.
#
# Example where we position the center of a decal to block position (row=2.5, col=3), and set decal size to (1x1):
#   decal = proba128x128x24.bmp 2.5 3 1 1

decal = proba128x128x24-blackbg.bmp 1.5 5.5 2 2
decal = proba128x128x24-blackbg.bmp 36 6 3 3

#  PICKUPABLE ITEMS  #
#                    #
######################

# Pickupable items:
# '2' char represents pistol.
# '3' char represents machine gun.
# '4' char represents bazooka.
# '5' char represents pusha.
# ',' char represents armor.
# '+' char represents health/medkit.
# Since these items are in the foreground, a background block might be implicitly
# created behind them, if there is a previously created NEIGHBOR background block
# next to them. In such case, that previous background block's texture will be
# applied, otherwise NO background block will be created behind the item.
# Currently there is no map item for knife because knife is always available for the player.

#  SPAWN POINTS  #
#                #
##################

# 'S' char represents spawn/start point. Multiple 'S' chars can be placed on the map.
# Number of spawn points might define the max allowed players on the map in the future but
# now players don't collide, so it is not yet a hard limit.
# A spawn point is similar to pickupable items but it is not visible.
# A background block might be implicitly created with the same rule as with pickupable items.
# Since a player can spawn only in standing position, placing a spawnpoint in a low-height
# tunnel where only crouching is possible, is considered as map design error.
#
# Note: when you are designing a map and testing it in the game, press 'T' as server player to randomly teleport
# between spawnpoints. Switch between teams also to test spawn groups.

##################
#                #
#  SPAWN GROUPS  #
#                #
##################

# Optionally, spawn points can be grouped to be exclusively available only for a specific team.
# This way, players within a specific team will be spawned only on spawn points of a specific spawn group.
# Useful if you want to restrict the spawn location for team members on the map.
# This is relevant only in team-based game modes, such as Team Deathmatch.
# Also, the "Team Spawn Groups" server setting needs to be enabled for this feature.
#
# Defining a spawn group is done using the following naming convention:
# spawngroup_#
# where # stands for the 1-based index of the specific team, e.g. spawngroup_1 is for team 1.
# Currently only team 1 and team 2 are supported, thus only spawngroup_1 and spawngroup_2 can be defined.
#
# Then, after the '=' character, the specific spawn point indices can be listed for this specific group,
# separated by space characters.
# Spawn point indices are 0-based, and the indices increase in the order as they are placed in the
# layout definition lines, left to right, top to bottom.
#
# Not all spawn points need to be placed in group. Spawn points not being in any group are excluded from
# potential spawn locations when the "Team Spawn Groups" server setting is enabled AND there are spawn groups
# defined for the map.
# Spawn groups are only relevant if the "Team Spawn Groups" server setting is enabled AND spawn groups are
# defined for the map.
#
# If a spawn group is defined for team 1, it is not necessary to define group for team 2: in that case, the
# rest of the spawn points are implicitly assigned to spawn group 2 to be exclusive for team 2.
# Therefore, defining spawn group 2 is recommended only if you want to exclude some of the spawn points from
# the potential spawning locations for any team.
#
# If all spawn points are assigned to spawn group 1, hence no remaining spawn points left for spawn group 2, then
# spawn group 1 is ignored and all players spawn randomly as if "Team Spawn Groups" server setting was disabled.
# An error log will appear because this is considered as map design error.
#
# Note: when you are designing a map and testing it in the game, press 'T' as server player to randomly teleport
# between spawnpoints. Switch between teams also to test spawn groups.
spawngroup_1 = 0
# spawngroup_2: no need explicit definition if we want the rest of the spawn points to be automatically added to it.

#  JUMP PADS  #
#             #
###############

# '^' char represents a jump pad that launches the player in the air vertically and/or horizontally.
# Jump pads are foreground blocks like walls thus the player collides with them.
# If there is a previous neighboring foreground block next to them, its texture will be applied, otherwise
# the texture specified for the '^' character will be used.
# Jump pads work only when approached from above, otherwise they don't launch the player in the air.

# The following texture is used for jump pads not having an immediate left foregound block neighbor next to them.
^ = floor.bmp

# You need to define how much jump force should be applied to the player by each jump pad.
# The way to do that is to define variables with the following naming convention:
# jumppad_#
# where # stands for the index of the specific jump pad.
#
# The indexing of jump pads starts from 0, and indices increase in the order as they are placed in the
# layout definition lines, left to right, top to bottom.
# The number of jump pad force definition variables must equal to the number of jump pads in the map layout.
#
# The value you set in the variable is actually 2 values:
# - vertical force multiplier
# - horizontal force multiplier (optional).
#
# The vertical multiplier is a multiplier of the INITIAL value of a regular player-induced vertical jump force (i.e. when you press jump button).
# It is important to understand that this changes the INITIAL value of the created jump force, e.g. setting 2.0 might result in a jump which is NOT exactly
# launching the player 2 times higher up in the air, you should experiment with different values to see how it works.
# Vertical multiplier must be positive.
#
# The horizontal multiplier is a multiplier of the INITIAL value of a regular player-induced horizontal jump force which is usually
# created when the player initiates the jump while also running, in such case the horizontal jump force continues to carry the player horizontally in the air.
# If horizontal multiplier is negative, the direction of the force is to the left, otherwise it is to the right.
#
# Only a simple space character is enough between the two multipliers.
#
# For example, to define the jump force for jump pad 0, to be a vertical force, with magnitude being the same as a regular jump:
# jumppad_0 = 1.0
#
# Note that setting exactly 1.0 for vertical is not recommended as it won't be completely handled as a jumppad-induced jump due to limitations in the code.
#
# To define a vertical jump force that is _initially_ 30% bigger than regular jump (might not be exactly result in a 30% higher jump):
# jumppad_0 = 1.3
#
# To define a jump force that also moves the player horizontally, with the vertical component _initially_ 100% bigger than with regular running:
# jumppad_0 = 1.3 2

jumppad_0 = 1
jumppad_1 = 2 2.4
jumppad_2 = 2.2 -3.3

#          #
#  STAIRS  #
#          #
############

# '/' and '\' chars are reserved for stairs blocks.
# '/' represents left-to-right ascending stairsteps.
# '\' represents left-to-right descending stairsteps.
# Such a single block will generate multiple small stairsteps within the area of the block.
#
# The stairsteps of an ascending ('/') stairs block use the texture of the next neighbor foreground block.
# Therefore, right after and ascending stairs block there must be at least 1 foreground block.
# The stairsteps of a descending ('\') stairs block use the texture of the previous neighbor foreground block.
# Therefore, right before a descending stairs block there must be at least 1 foreground block.
#
# In summary: /X\ is ok (X is any of the foreground block characters), but /\ is NOT ok.
# Between '/' and '\' can be multiple foreground blocks, but at least one.
#
# A map layout line cannot start with '/' and cannot end with '\'.
# This restriction can be lift upon request in the future but for now it would break some calculations.
