Name = Collision Test Map

# This test map recreates cases that were handled wrongly by the BVH collision detection implementation in PRooFPS-dd v0.5.
# So this map is expected to have bad collision in v0.5 when BVH collision method is enabled.
# But this map shall work flawlessly in v0.5.1 with BVH collision method.

# The following chars are used for defining foreground blocks in this map:
# Remaining chars to be used as foreground blocks in this map: BDGHIKLQT

F = floor.bmp

# The following chars are used for defining background blocks in this map:
# Remaining chars to be used as background blocks in this map: acmnopruvwxyz
e = texture-atlas.bmp 0.02 0.02 0.48 0.48

# This is the minimum layout that recreates the collision problem in v0.5.
# As soon as we decrease either the map size vertically by 1 line, or
# horizontally by moving the right-side 'e' 1 column left, the problem disappears.
# Also, the problem disappears if we delete any of the foreground blocks.
