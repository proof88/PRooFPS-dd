# Which map should be loaded by server before looping mapcycle?
sv_map = map_test_good.txt
# If left empty, then server immediately starts to loop the mapcycle (gamedata/maps/mapcycle.txt).
# If a map is specified here, it will precede other maps listed in the mapcycle.
# Clients load maps as instructed by the server instance.

# Should server allow players to modify their horizontal movement mid-air?
sv_allow_strafe_mid_air = true
# A lot of FPS games such as CS 1.6 and Quake 3 allow it.
# Some other games such as the original Prince of Persia don't allow.

# Should server allow player to FULLY modify their horizontal movement mid-air?
sv_allow_strafe_mid_air_full = false
# Effective only if sv_allow_strafe_mid_air is also true.
# An example of full mid-air strafe control is Super Mario where the player can also negate the initial strafe direction.

# Crouch automatically for easier triggering mid-air somersault?
sv_somersault_mid_air_auto_crouch = true
# Somersaulting can be done only while crouching.
# If set, mid-air somersault can be triggered by an easy double jump combo as crouching is automatic for the duration of the somersault.
# Otherwise, triggering mid-air somersault requires the following input combo: jump-crouch-jump.
# Mid-air somersaulting can be triggered only during jump-up, and not when falling or standing on the ground.

# Your name as to be shown in the frag table.
cl_name = Player
# Used by server and client instances.
# The max length for name is defined as 10 ASCII characters.
# Server instance makes sure there is no collision between player names.
# If left as empty, the game will generate a unique name.

# Developer note for cl_name: max length 10 is coming from: (MsgUserNameChange::nUserNameBufferLength - 1).
# Can be longer later if we solve the server-side frag table display to show long names properly without obscuring other columns.

# Show main menu at startup and when exiting a game session.
gui_mainmenu = true
# The primary function of the main menu is to allow easy and straightforward modification of this cfg file.
# If you disable it, the only way to modify the configuration is to manually edit this file or use command-line arguments.
# Auto-tests currently don't expect main menu thus they disable it from command-line.

# Base frequency of updating game state (physics, weapons, etc., e.g.: 60 means update them 60 times per second).
tickrate = 60
# Higher value is better.
# Both server and client use it.
# Good to keep it high for more precise player object control since even though user input is sampled at framerate, controlling the player
# object is done at tickrate.
# The idea is to have game state update rate decoupled from the framerate, so that a too low or too high or an extremely variable framerate
# won't affect us negatively since each tick is simulated with FIXED delta time steps, even if the framerate is unplayable low.
# Furthermore, there is no use to simulate physics too frequently either, e.g. if FPS is 1000, physics simulation frequency is adequate at 60 Hz.
#
# Rule: 20 <= tickrate <= max framerate (which is const 60 Hz currently in PRooFPS-dd).


# Minimum frequency of updating physics simulation (e.g.: 60 means it should be updated minimum 60 times per second).
physics_rate_min = 60
# Higher value is better.
# Higher value results in more precise physics calculations, but more server-side CPU usage.
# Both server and client use it.
# Server simulates physics at this frequency but this does not have impact on "server -> client" network traffic.
# Client use it only for simulating bullet movement (for visuals only since server has the authority on bullet hit detection).
#
# If tickrate is too low, physics calculation results may allow missed collisions between objects: fast objects may "jump over" walls,
# players might miss jumping into smaller holes or "entrances".
# To avoid these, the game can run multiple physics iterations per tick with smaller fixed timesteps.
# However, it is good to keep it high so that the same sampled player input is repeated less times per tick in the physics iterations.
#
# Rules:
#   tickrate <= physics_rate_min (there must be at least 1 physics iteration per tick),
#   physics_rate_min % tickrate == 0 (physics update distribution in time should be constant/even),
#   physics_rate_min <= 60           (due to some limitation in the game).
#
# The number of physics iterations per tick is calculated as:
#   max(1, physics_rate_min / tickrate).


# Frequency at which server sends updates to clients (e.g.: 60 means clients are updated 60 times per second).
cl_updaterate = 60
# Higher value is better.
# Higher value results in clients receiving game state updates more frequently, but it also increases "server -> client" network traffic.
# It also affects the server-side player updates of the server player, so it is easy to test it by running the server instance only.
#
# Rules:
#   0 < cl_updaterate <= tickrate,
#   tickrate % cl_updaterate == 0 (clients should receive UPDATED physics results evenly distributed in time).

# Developer note: cl_updaterate is server-only property, thus it should have name like "sv_clupdaterate", but we mimic CS 1.6 CVAR naming.

# Debug: increase this for client to simulate slower rendering. Millisecs. Min value is 1.
#cl_extra_render_delay = 10


# Time in seconds to wait before trying to connect back to server.
cl_reconnect_delay = 2
# Example situation is map changing.
# Increasing it is good for testing situation when client is coming back slower than the server.

# Enabling results in better visual quality.
# V-Sync is useful for avoiding the screen tearing effect that happens when framerate and screen refresh rate are out of sync.
# However, if you enable V-Sync, the maximum available framerate will be the screen refresh rate, and in some cases it can cause
# significantly lower framerate than otherwise would be available.
# If you have too low framerate, try disabling it.
