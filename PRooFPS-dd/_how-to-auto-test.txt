Currently there are 2 kinds of automated tests:

 - unit- and performance tests
   - these are compiled as per compiler settings stored in "DebugTest_PRooFPS-dd" and "ReleaseTest_PRooFPS-dd" configurations;

 - regression tests:
   - these are starting up PRooFPS-dd.exe in the main PRooFPS-dd directory, and simulating user input,
     measure packets, check frag table, etc.

All kinds of automated tests can be easily run with the steps below:

 - build a Release version of the game with "Release" configuration;

 - copy the built PRooFPS-dd.exe from Release directory to the main PRooFPS-dd directory, overwrite the existing .exe there.

 - in Tests/PRooFPS-dd-Tests.cpp, check that all tests are uncommented;

 - change configuration to either "DebugTest_PRooFPS-dd" or "ReleaseTest_PRooFPS-dd", build and run it, and make sure all tests pass.

Note: difference between configurations "DebugTest_PRooFPS-dd" and "ReleaseTest_PRooFPS-dd" have effect on the build type of the tests.
Unit- and performance tests are recommended to be built and run with both "DebugTest_PRooFPS-dd" and "ReleaseTest_PRooFPS-dd" configurations.

Therefore, if you want to run regression test on Release version of PRooFPS-dd, you need to build a release version of PRooFPS-dd first
and then copy it in the main PRooFPS-dd directory as already explained above!
