Currently there are 2 kinds of automated tests:

 - unit tests
   - these are compiled as per compiler settings stored in "DebugTest_PRooFPS-dd" configuration;

 - regression tests:
   - these are starting up PRooFPS-dd.exe in the main PRooFPS-dd directory, and simulating user input,
     measure packets, check frag table, etc.

All kinds of automated tests can be easily run with the steps below:

 - build a Release version of the game with "Release" configuration;

 - copy the built PRooFPS-dd.exe from Release directory to the main PRooFPS-dd directory, overwrite the existing .exe there.

 - in Tests/PRooFPS-dd-Tests.cpp, check that all tests are uncommented;

 - change configuration to "DebugTest_PRooFPS-dd", build and run it, and make sure all tests pass.
