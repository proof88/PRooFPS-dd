 Start a server instance in any Game Mode, and 2 client instances (and connect them to server), then:
   - make sure the weapon switch for the server player and 1st client player is correctly visible in the 2nd client instance, and vice versa;
   - make sure that the player can go into the small tunnel on the very left side of warhouse by crouch+jumping;
   - with the default 1.5x jump-force multiplier setting, player should not take fall damage after a normal mid-air salto.

   - 3D sound check:
     - mute server and 1 client instance, check if you hear proper sound (other players' walk, shooting, falling-from-high-yell) in the unmuted client instance;
     - mute the client instance, unmute the other client, check for same proper sounds (other players' walk, shooting, falling-from-high-yell);
     - mute both client instances, unmute server and check for same proper sounds (other players' walk, shooting, falling-from-high-yell).

   - check if bouncing bullet is actually bouncing properly between foreground objects (grenade launcher);
   - check if non-bouncing bullets are actually able to ricochet off the wall (hit angle <= 10 degrees).
