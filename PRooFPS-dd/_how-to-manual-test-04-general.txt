 Start a server instance in any Game Mode, then:
   - make sure that the player can go into the small tunnel on the very left side of warhouse by crouch+jumping;
   - with the default 1.5x jump-force multiplier setting, player should not take fall damage after a normal mid-air salto;
   - player shall be able to jump during running down or up stairs.

 Start 1 client instance and connect it to server, then:
   - Check if Server Admin menu actions such as Restart Game and Next Map are working properly (with client still connected to server).
     - Not only player stats need to be reset for all players but everybody must be in spectator mode again.
     - Check these also when a game is already won and we are waiting for the game to restart (with client still connected to server).
 
 Start 1 more client instance and connect it to server (so now there shall be 2 connected client instances), then:
   - make sure the weapon switch for the server player and 1st client player is correctly visible in the 2nd client instance, and vice versa;
   
   - 3D sound check:
     - mute server and 1 client instance, check if you hear proper sound (other players' walk, shooting, falling-from-high-yell) in the unmuted client instance;
     - mute the client instance, unmute the other client, check for same proper sounds (other players' walk, shooting, falling-from-high-yell);
     - mute both client instances, unmute server and check for same proper sounds (other players' walk, shooting, falling-from-high-yell).

   - check if bouncing bullet is actually bouncing properly between foreground objects (grenade launcher);
   - check if non-bouncing bullets are actually able to ricochet off the wall (hit angle <= 10 degrees).

   - Spectator Mode:
     - check if all players can correctly enter into Spectator Mode:
       - right after connecting to server,
       - later back from active gameplay.
     - check if all spectating camera modes are working properly:
       - free camera control spectating mode,
       - player follow camera spectating mode.

 
   - Make the game won somehow (e.g. 10 sec time limit) while the 2 clients are also connected, so for all 3 instances the end-game results are shown.
     Disconnect the 2 clients, then reconnect them to the server while still the end-game results are shown.
     Expectation: again the end-game results are shown for the reconnected clients.

   - Now disconnect the 2 clients, stop the server session and start a new server with a different game mode.
     Repeat the previous test, expectation is the same.
