 - Start a server instance with "Team Deathmatch" Game Mode, and 1 client instance (connect it to server), then test the following:
   - Friendly fire working as per current config?
     - Check simple bullets (e.g. pistol, machine gun) DIRECTLY hitting other players,
     - Check non-bouncing explosive bullets (e.g. rocket) DIRECTLY hitting other players,
     - Check bouncing explosive bullets (e.g. grenade) DIRECTLY hitting other players,
       - note: owner of bouncing bullet cannot trigger explosion by colliding with such bullet.
     - Check explosive bullets causing INDIRECT player damage within their damage radius:
       - with friendly fire active, enemies and teammates and the owner are all taking damage within damage radius of explosion,
       - with friendly fire off, only enemies and the owner of the explosion are taking damage within damage radius of explosion,
         - note: impact force created by explosion still affects everyone within damage radius!
     - Check DIRECTLY hitting fragile bullets:
       - with friendly fire active, enemies and teammates can also destroy each other's fragile bullets,
       - with friendly fire off, teammates cannot destroy each other's fragile bullets, only enemies can.
     - Check INDIRECTLY hitting fragile bullets:
       - with friendly fire active, enemies' and teammates' fragile bullets can be destroyed within each other's explosion radius,
       - with friendly fire off, only enemies' fragile bullets can be destroyed within each other's explosion radius.
   
   - Team Spawn Groups working as per current config?
   - Check if Frag Table shows the 2 teams properly (players grouped by teams, ordered by frags within teams).
   - Check if any non-first team change actually increases death count by 1.

 - Now disconnect the client and server instances, and invert the Friendly fire and Team Spawn Groups config, then
   repeat the above tests.

 - Check if Server Admin menu actions such as Restart Game and Next Map are working properly (with client still connected to server).
   - Not only player stats but team id also need to be reset for all players and everybody must be in spectator mode again.
   - Check these also when a game is already won and we are waiting for the game to restart (with client still connected to server).
