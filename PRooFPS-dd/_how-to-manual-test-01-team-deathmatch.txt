 - Start a server instance with "Team Deathmatch" Game Mode, and 1 client instance (connect it to server), then test the following:
   - Friendly fire working as per current config?
   - Team Spawn Groups working as per current config?
   - Check if Frag Table shows the 2 teams properly (players grouped by teams, ordered by frags within teams).
   - Check if any non-first team change actually increases death count by 1.

 - Now disconnect the client and server instances, and invert the Friendly fire and Team Spawn Groups config, then
   repeat the above tests.

 - Check if Server Admin menu actions such as Restart Game and Next Map are working properly (with client still connected to server).
   - Check these also when a game is already won and we are waiting for the game to restart (with client still connected to server).
