 - update game version number in Consts.h (GAME_VERSION);

 - build a Release version with "Release" configuration;

 - copy the built PRooFPS-dd.exe to the main PRooFPS-dd directory, overwrite the existing .exe there;

 - change configuration to "DebugTest_PRooFPS-dd" and make sure all tests pass;

 - manual test: start a server instance and 2 client instances, then:
   - make sure the weapon switch for the server player and 1st client player is correctly visible in the 2nd client instance, and vice versa;
   - make sure that the player can go into the small tunnel on the very left side of warhouse by crouch+jumping;
   - with the default 1.5x jump-force multiplier setting, player should not take fall damage after a normal mid-air salto;

 - 3D sound check:
   - mute server and 1 client instance, check if you hear proper sound in the unmuted client instance;
   - mute the client instance, unmute the other client, check for same proper sounds;
   - mute both client instances, unmute server and check for same proper sounds.

 - check game in fullscreen too, since now it is also officially supported!

 - make a separate directory for this new version under OldRegTestDumps directory and copy all
   "RegTestDump*.txt" files there so we will have a saved reference later for packet numbers later, these
   are also (should be) version-controlled;

 - update the packet rate and packet data rate calculations in https://github.com/proof88/PGE/blob/master/PGE/docpages/menu-04-Networking.md ;

 - if this is a bigger version number increment, it would be nice also to create a new benchmark measurement
   stored in OldPerfMeasurements directory, to understand if we have improvement or regression wrt performance;
   later this should be automatized;

 - make sure default config is what you want a new user to see when they load up the game for the first time;

 - make a new directory somewhere based on the copy of the previous released game directory, and from our develop
   directory, copy the binaries and the "gamedata" directory, fully overwriting everything;

 - make sure the LICENSE file is also copied into the main directory of the game;

 - delete any recently generated log file from the directory;

 - delete any test-purpose map from gamedata/maps and other unneeded files from other directories under gamedata dir;

 - check if game is able to start up from this new release directory, if so then compress and upload to Google Drive (to the usual LAN directory);

 - check if game is able to start up on a separate machine after downloading;

 - update the wiki page on github (README.md), especially the "Try the game", "Debugging" and "History" sections;

 - make sure you pull the updated README.md, and then push a new commit including the changes regarding the
   RegTestDump files described above;

 - finally, make a new git tag, e.g.: "v0.1.5-PrivateBeta".
