 - update game version number in Consts.h (GAME_VERSION);

 - make sure any recently added licensed stuff is mentioned in the About menu;

 - delete all previous reg test dumps ("RegTestDump*.txt") from the main PRooFPS-dd directory;

 - make a separate directory for this new version under OldRegTestDumps directory and copy all
   the new reg test dumps there, but only run for Team Deathmatch game mode, and without the
   map switching tests, so we will have a saved reference later for packet numbers later, these
   are also (should be) version-controlled;

 - run ALL auto tests as explained in _how-to-auto-test.txt;

 - run manual tests as explained in _how-to-manual-test.txt;

 - update the packet rate and packet data rate calculations in PRooFPS-dd/doc/PRooFPS-dd-Packet-Rates.xlsx ;

 - if this is a bigger version number increment, it would be nice also to create a new benchmark measurement
   stored in OldPerfMeasurements directory, to understand if we have improvement or regression wrt performance;
   later this should be automatized;

 - make sure default config is what you want a new user to see when they load up the game for the first time;

 - make a new directory somewhere based on the copy of the previous released game directory, and from our develop
   directory, copy the binaries and the "gamedata" directory, fully overwriting everything;

 - make sure the LICENSE file is also copied into the main directory of the game;

 - delete any recently generated log file from the directory;

 - except map_test_good, delete any other test-purpose map from gamedata/maps and other unneeded files from other directories under gamedata dir;

 - check if game is able to start up from this new release directory, if so then compress and upload to Google Drive (to the usual LAN directory);

 - check if game is able to start up on a separate machine after downloading;

 - update the wiki page on github (README.md), especially the "Try the game" and "Debugging" sections;

 - update the version changes page "History" (HISTORY.md);

 - make sure you pull the updated README.md, and then push a new commit including the changes regarding the
   RegTestDump files described above;

 - finally, make a new git tag, e.g.: "v0.1.5-PrivateBeta".
