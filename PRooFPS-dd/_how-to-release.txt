 - update game version number in Consts.h (GAME_VERSION);

 - make sure any recently added licensed stuff is mentioned in the About menu;

 - delete all previous reg test dumps ("RegTestDump*.txt") from the main PRooFPS-dd directory;

 - run auto tests as explained in _how-to-auto-test.txt;

 - make a separate directory for this new version under OldRegTestDumps directory and copy all
   the new reg test dumps there so we will have a saved reference later for packet numbers later, these
   are also (should be) version-controlled;

 - run manual tests as explained in _how-to-manual-test.txt;

 - update the packet rate and packet data rate calculations in https://github.com/proof88/PGE/blob/master/PGE/docpages/menu-04-Networking.md ;

 - if this is a bigger version number increment, it would be nice also to create a new benchmark measurement
   stored in OldPerfMeasurements directory, to understand if we have improvement or regression wrt performance;
   later this should be automatized;

 - make sure default config is what you want a new user to see when they load up the game for the first time;

 - make a new directory somewhere based on the copy of the previous released game directory, and from our develop
   directory, copy the binaries and the "gamedata" directory, fully overwriting everything;

 - make sure the LICENSE file is also copied into the main directory of the game;

 - delete any recently generated log file from the directory;

 - except map_test_good, delete any other test-purpose map from gamedata/maps and other unneeded files from other directories under gamedata dir;

 - check if game is able to start up from this new release directory, if so then compress and upload to Google Drive (to the usual LAN directory);

 - check if game is able to start up on a separate machine after downloading;

 - update the wiki page on github (README.md), especially the "Try the game", "Debugging" and "History" sections;

 - make sure you pull the updated README.md, and then push a new commit including the changes regarding the
   RegTestDump files described above;

 - finally, make a new git tag, e.g.: "v0.1.5-PrivateBeta".
